    <h1>Most Beautiful Cities</h1>

                <h2>Paris</h2>
                <p>This one's a given, right? Paris is a place where romance and history play side by side. Cafés line cobblestone streets, beautiful people stroll along the Seine at all hours, and every neighborhood seems to have its own iconic landmark, be it the Notre Dame, Sacré-Coeur, or Eiffel Tower.

                <h2>Sydney</h2>
                <p>It's almost not fair how pretty Sydney is. Australia’s biggest city benefits from a waterfront culture, with locals hopping on ferries to commute home—or play—on Bondi, Manly, and Coogee beaches, and the dramatic Sydney Opera House standing sentry in the harbor.

                <h2>Istanbul</h2>
                <p>
                    Istanbul continues to draw us in, whether it's through the frenetic opulence of the Grand Bazaar or the old-meets-new aesthetic of Karaköy. But the architecture still shines brightest here, with the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia featuring prominent displays of both Byzantine and Ottoman styles.
